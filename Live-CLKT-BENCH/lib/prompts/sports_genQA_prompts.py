GEN_FACTQA_TEMPLATE = """
You are generating high-quality multiple-choice QA pairs in {lang}, strictly grounded in the provided sports game information.

You will be provided with:
- Sports Game Title
- Date
- League
- Teams
- Score
- Game Details / Stats

Task:
- Generate natural, audience-friendly questions that game viewer might realistically ask about the game.
- All questions must be written fully in {lang}, including the leading phrase (“In the sports game: '<title>' at '<date>', …”).
- Each QA pair must be based ONLY on facts explicitly present in the input. Do not add, assume, or hallucinate.
- Use diverse aspects (teams, score, venue, stats, notable events).
- Ensure the question is clear and unambiguous.

Each QA pair must include:
- **Question** in {lang}. 
- **Options**:
    - Provide four options labeled A, B, C, D.
    - Exactly one option is correct.
    - Place the correct option randomly among the four choice.
    - Distractors must be plausible but wrong (no random, absurd, or unrelated answers).
- **Correct Option**: Output the letter (A, B, C, or D) of the correct answer.

--------------------------
Inputs:
{meta_data}

--------------------------
Output Format (JSON):
{{
    "QA": [
        {{
            "question": "<string in {lang}>",

Guidelines:
- Write everything (questions and options) only in {lang}.
- Ensure every correct answer can be directly verified in the input metadata.
- Distractors must be reasonable, related, and plausible.

Metadata:

Check carefully:
- Is the correct option explicitly supported by the metadata?
- If yes, return SUPPORTED and also provide the exact sentence(s) from metadata that support it.
- If the correct option does not appear in or cannot be inferred from the metadata, return UNSUPPORTED.

Output Format:
Return a single JSON object with this structure:

2. Do NOT translate or modify:
    - The field names ("QA", "question", "options", "correct_option", "A", "B", "C", "D").
    - The "correct_option" value (keep it exactly as "A", "B", "C", or "D").
    - Any proper names (teams, players, leagues, stadiums).
3. Keep the JSON structure, formatting, and order exactly the same as input.
4. Keep question natural and fluent in the target language.
